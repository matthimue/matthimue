As a musician and engineer, I'm interested in musical projects that also involve electronic design - in that order!    

As an electronic engineer and developer with a job history in telecommunication, semiconductor and automotive industry, I've always been interested in noticing how technical projects come and go. My common learning :   

*"Engineering is considered sustainable when you think of it as the job to **'develop the future'** based on real world requirements  - On the other hand engineering resources are wasted - and this might be too often - when you think of it as the job to develop **'just because you can'**.*
